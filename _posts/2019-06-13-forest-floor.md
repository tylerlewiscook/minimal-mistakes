A collaborator and I recently sumbitted a manuscript analyzing metabolomic data.  Part of the analysis involed building a random forest model for classifying patient disease status using metabolite concentrations.  The journal we submitted to required an image for a graphical table of contents.  I decided this would be a good opportunity to show off the cool things that can be done using the [forestFloor](http://forestfloor.dk/) package in R.
