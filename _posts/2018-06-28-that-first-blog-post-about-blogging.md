title: That First Blog Post About Blogging
---

To get things started off, I thought I would explain some of the details about how this site came into existence.  I can’t remember coming across any particular site that really served as motivation, but somehow, I read about [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and Jekyll.  I don’t really have any experience with website creation and design so I had to rely on Google and the numerous resources that others have graciously shared online to figure out how to get things to work. 

Starting with the basics, I found this YouTube video which appears to be a recording of a workshop from the University of Idaho Library:

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=SWVjQsvQocA&feature=youtu.be
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/SWVjQsvQocA&feature=youtu.be/0.jpg" 
alt=" " width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>

After watching most of that video and looking over the accompanying website, I decided I would take a learn-by-doing approach and start working on customizing my own site.  First off, I wanted to pick a slick theme.  None of the built-in Jekyll themes available straight form GitHub Pages did too much for me so I did some searching for alternatives.  That’s when I came across [Minimal Mistakes]( https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) and the corresponding (and super helpful) [Quick-Start Guide]( https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/).  There is a Minimal Mistakes template available on GitHub that I forked and started editing.  And that brings us to here...
