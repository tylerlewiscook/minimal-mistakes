My main research interests are in survival analysis focusing on interval-censored data, informative censoring, and variable selection.  I am also interested in longitudinal data analysis, bioinformatics, data mining, and machine learning.  While at the University of Missouri, I consulted for members of an evolutionary biology lab, and for a psychologist studying autism.  At the University of Central Oklahoma, I work with groups of undergraduates undertaking consulting work as part of [Project SCHOLAR](http://math.uco.edu/resources/scholar/index.html).
